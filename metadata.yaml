description: "The Green Odyssey is an American science fiction novel written by Philip\
  \ José Farmer. It was Farmer's first book-length publication, originally released\
  \ by Ballantine in 1957. Unlike Farmer's most prolific earlier short story work,\
  \ this book contains no sexual themes, though his next book Flesh returned to these\
  \ motifs. The novel also appeared in the back ground of the first episode of The\
  \ Twilight Zone.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
